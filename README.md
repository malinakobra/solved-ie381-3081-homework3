Considering the Example 2.6 (named as “Able-Baker Call Center Problem”) described in the lectures and given in the textbook, simulate a queue system with two servers. Use the same terminology given in the example.

<ul>

 <li>Build the simulation model and define the scenario with the given input values (e.g. arrival and service distributions). Analyze the system simulating the arrival and service of the customers. Measure the performance of the system.</li>

 <li>Replicate the model or build a new scenario with new arrival and service distributions. Values will be your own. Measure the performance of the new system.</li>

 <li>Compare two systems based on performance metrics. Make your comments on the performance results and their comparison.</li>

</ul>
